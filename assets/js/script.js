Start off with a page that introduces them to the quiz with a buttom that activates on click to continue to quiz

Have a timer at the top right that starts at 80 seconds.

Have the first question appear, and then have the timer goes down

If user answers correctly, move on to the next question

If user doesn't answer correctly, we subtract some time from the clock.

The game is over when the user answers all the questions, or the timer hits 0, and whatever time is left will be the users score.

Give the user their score and ask user to put in their initials.
